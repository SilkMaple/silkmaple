  <h1>Return Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Important:</strong> Please read our return policy carefully. No exceptions will be made, as you agreed to the terms at the time of purchase.</p>

  <h2>Returning</h2>

  <p><strong>Timeframe:</strong> You have 14 days from the date you receive your product to return it. If 14 days have passed, we regret that we cannot offer a refund or exchange.</p>

  <p><strong>Conditions:</strong> The returned product must be in the same condition as when you received it, unused and in its original packaging. For products where hygiene is important, they must be thoroughly cleaned before starting the return process.</p>

  <p><strong>Exclusions:</strong> Due to hygiene reasons, some products cannot be returned, such as underwear, lingerie, pantyhoses, shoes, socks, sunglasses and certain personal care products. Sale items cannot be returned, these are considered final sale.</p>

  <p><strong>Initiating the Process:</strong> If you wish to return a product, please send an email to: <a href="mailto:customersupport@silkmaple.com">customersupport@silkmaple.com</a> with your order number, reason for return, any photos of the product if damaged, and your contact information.</p>

  <h2>Refund</h2>

  <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> After receiving and inspecting your return, we will send you an email to approve or reject your refund. If approved, your refund will be automatically applied to your credit card or original payment method within 30 days.</p>

  <p><strong>Late or Missing Refund:</strong> If you have not received your refund after 30 days, please check your bank account first. If you still have not received it, contact us via <a href="mailto:customersupport@silkmaple.com">customersupport@silkmaple.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>Costs</h2>

  <p><strong>Return Shipping Costs:</strong> All customers are responsible for return shipping costs. We recommend using Track &amp; Trace for your return shipment, as we are not responsible for lost returns. The return shipment must be sent to Asia to the address provided to you by us. Return shipping costs usually start at $25 and are the responsibility of the customer.</p>

  <p><strong>Exceptions:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Defective or Incorrect Products:</strong> If you receive a defective or incorrect product, we will send a new one free of charge. If the issue persists the second time, you will receive a full refund of the purchase price.</li>
    <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> Orders cannot be cancelled once they are placed due to our automated system.</li>
  </ul>
